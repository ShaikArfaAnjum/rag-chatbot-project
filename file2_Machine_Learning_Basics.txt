Machine Learning (ML)
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms that allow computers to learn from data without explicit programming.
Types of ML:
Supervised Learning: Uses labeled data to train models to predict outcomes.
Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns or clusters in unlabeled data.
Reinforcement Learning: Trains agents to make sequential decisions by rewarding desired actions.
Applications of ML:
Recommendation systems
Fraud detection
Predictive analytics
Key Components:
Datasets
Feature extraction
Model training
Evaluation
Optimization
