Neural Networks
Neural Networks are computational models inspired by the human brain’s structure and function. 
They consist of layers of interconnected nodes called neurons, which process input data and transmit signals to subsequent layers.
Neural networks can be shallow (few layers) or deep (many layers), with deep neural networks forming the foundation of deep learning.
They are highly effective in recognizing patterns in images, speech, and text.
Training neural networks involves adjusting the weights of connections using algorithms such as backpropagation and gradient descent.
Popular Types of Neural Networks:
Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs)
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
