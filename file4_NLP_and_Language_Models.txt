Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that deals 
with the interaction between computers and human language. 
NLP enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate text or speech in a meaningful way.
Language models are a core part of NLP, predicting the probability of a sequence of words and 
generating human-like text. Recent advances include transformer-based models like GPT, BERT, and LLaMA, 
which can perform tasks such as text summarization, translation, sentiment analysis, and question answering.
NLP is used in chatbots, virtual assistants, search engines, and automated content generation. 
Embeddings are used to represent words or documents in vector space for semantic understanding.
