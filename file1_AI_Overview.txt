Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed
 to think and learn. 
AI enables machines to perform tasks such as problem-solving, decision-making, perception,
and language understanding. It is widely used in various industries including healthcare, finance,
 education, and entertainment. AI systems can be rule-based or data-driven,
  with modern AI relying heavily on machine learning and deep learning methods. 
  The goal of AI is to create systems that can adapt, reason, and operate autonomously in dynamic environments.
AI has grown rapidly due to advances in computing power, data availability, and sophisticated algorithms.
